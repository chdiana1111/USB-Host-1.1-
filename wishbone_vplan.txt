- all signals must have active high logic.

   1) Checkers: 
check that when rst = 1, all signals go to 0? (maybe add noise on the wishbone_data, wishbone_addr).
check that the slave asserts ack only in response to the assertion of the stb signal.
check that the slave asserts err only in response to the assertion of the stb signal.
check that the slave asserts rty only in response to the assertionof the stb signal.
check that only ack or err or rty assert in response to the stb signal.
check that the cyc remains asserted while a valid cycle is in progress.
check that stb remains asserted until the slave responds with either ack, err or rty.
check that asserting ack and the err signals terminate the transfer cycle.
